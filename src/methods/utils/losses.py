    Calculates an approximation of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel when multiple classes are in the data.

    This function takes as input a tensor representing the clusters, the number of clusters, a tensor representing 
    the hidden states, the sigma parameter for the RBF kernel, and a boolean indicating whether to compute the MMD 
    with all clusters or only the current one. The function returns a tensor representing the MMD for each cluster.

    Parameters:
        cluster (torch.Tensor): The clusters. A 1D tensor with the cluster for each observation.
        num_cluster (int): The number of clusters.
        hidden (torch.Tensor): The hidden states. A 2D tensor where each row is a hidden state and each column is a feature.
        sigma (float, optional): The sigma parameter for the RBF kernel. Defaults to 0.1.
        comp_with_all (bool, optional): Whether to compute the MMD with all clusters or only the current one. Defaults to True.
        kwargs: Dummy to improve compatibility with other functions.

    Returns:
